Deep_learning_for_powerline_monitoring_using_UAS_imagery
==============================

The goal of this project is to develop a deep learning approach for automated damage detection in distribution power line inspection images. The method will be trained on a high-resolution image dataset labeled with different types of equipment and damage, and it will be able to identify and classify electric transmission equipment and determine if it is damaged or not.
